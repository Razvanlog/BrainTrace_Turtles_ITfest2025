            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At BrainTrace, we want to make medical imaging smarter and easier with AI. Our goal is to help doctors find and understand health problems faster, so patients can get the right treatment sooner. We believe that technology should support healthcare professionals, not replace them.
            
            By using AI, we can make medical analysis more accurate, reduce waiting times, and help doctors focus on what really mattersâ€”caring for people. Our mission is to bring reliable, easy-to-use AI tools to hospitals and clinics, making healthcare better for everyone.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>BrainTrace is an AI-powered tool designed to help doctors detect brain tumors quickly and accurately. Using advanced machine learning, our system analyzes MRI scans to identify different types of tumors and assist in early diagnosis.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Glioma</li>
                <li>Meningioma</li>
                <li>Pituitary Tumor</li>
                <li>No Tumor</li>
            </ul>
            <p>BrainTrace does not replace medical professionals but serves as a second opinion, helping doctors analyze MRI results faster and with greater accuracy. Our goal is to support early detection and improve patient care.</p>
